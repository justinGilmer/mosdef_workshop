The `Particle` class is used to define `Compounds` residing at the lowest level of the containment hierarchy. Standard mBuild protocol is to define `Particle` names according to their elemental symbol (e.g. `'C'`), or to preface `Particle` names by an underscore for coarse-grained beads (e.g. `'_CH4'`). This aids in the atomtyping and forcefield application process (using the Foyer package) which we will get back to later.\n",
